# using kubernetes we can create lot of things like
# Pods , services , etc . we call them objects
# apiVersion says to kubernetes to look at the pool of
# of objects from which we can create different objects
# in this case look inside version 1
apiVersion: v1

# Then we specify which type of object we want to create
# from the pool . so in this case we want a POD
# Pod will wrap up a container

kind: Pod

# Meta data about the object

metadata:
  name: posts

# List of specifications about the specified object that we
# want to create
# spec - specification
# this is the precise definition as to what will go
# inside this pod and how the pod should behave

spec:
  containers:
    # the (-) entity means we want an array entity
    # in this case we want to create only 1 container
