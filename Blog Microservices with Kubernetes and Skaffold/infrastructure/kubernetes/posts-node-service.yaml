# Services are of 4 types
# 1. Cluster IP - Communication b/w pods
# 2. Node Port - Communication b/w pod and outside world
# 3. Load Balancer - Communication b/w pod and outside world ( group of pods)
# 4.External Name - Advanced

# here i am just exposing a pod to outside world
# correct way to do so is to use a load balancer but
# since this is for test purposes we will create a node
# service

apiVersion: v1

kind: Service

metadata:
  name: posts-node-service
# Now specifying the specifications of the service
spec:
  # type of service
  type: NodePort
  # then selector will select all the pods with matching labels
  selector:
    app: posts
  # then we expose port with protocols and an alias
  ports:
    - name: posts
      protocol: TCP
      # this is the port for the node port service and then it will automatically assign
      # a nodePort that will be used for access finally
      port: 4000
      # This is the port for the container
      targetPort: 4000
