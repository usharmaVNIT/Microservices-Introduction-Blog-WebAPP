# we can write a cluster ip service (see client-node-service.yaml )
# inside the deployment file as there is a one to one mapping
# b/w deployment and cluster ip ( i.e to allow communication b/w
# pods) . we can also create a seperate file
# to create a new yaml we use --- 3 dashes that seperates
# yaml files
